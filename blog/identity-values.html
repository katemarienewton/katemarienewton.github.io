      EXPLAIN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE MADE AN ETHICAL DECISION. DISCUSS HOW YOU WEIGHED UP THE VALUES INVOLVED IN THAT DECISION, THE DECISION YOU MADE, AND HOW YOU REFLECT ON THE DECISION NOW.
    </p>
    <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
      I have examples of this in my personal life that have really shaped my life but I would rather not put that online haha. I can say the times I’ve had to make big ethical decisions have always been with my gut. I feel an innate sense of what the right thing to do is and I always feel it very overwhelmingly. Often like most ethical decisions it comes at a cost of losing something which makes it hard. I have always made the decision that promotes long term grow and wellbeing of myself and the people around me. I reflect on these times as it has always come at a cost but I feel as though it was the best decision that caused the least harm.

      DESCRIBE HOW YOUR CULTURE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU HAVE INFLUENCED YOUR VALUES AND IDENTITY.
    </p>
      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        Have been really lucky to have been surrounded by heaps of kind and thoughtful people in my life. My mums a lady who is very sure of herself and has rubbed off on me big time. I believe a bit in tough love, I think it teaches you to hold yourself accountable to stuff and helps you get up when you’re down. I trust my gut before anything else and that’s big in my family.

        IDENTIFY YOUR STRENGTHS AND HOW THEY WILL SUPPORT YOU DURING YOUR LEARNING JOURNEY.

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        I’m pretty friendly and easygoing which should make collaboration pretty chill. I’m not someone who gets too stressed and has a pretty even temperament. This will stop me being overwhelmed.

        EVALUATE YOUR LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF YOUR LEARNING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT. HOW MIGHT THESE AFFECT YOUR LEARNING JOURNEY?

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        My job is pretty random and I get fatigued / have sleep debt pretty often. This means my schedule is extremely irregular and I imagine pretty different from everyone else in this course. Means I rather do things way early in case they change my roster.

      SHARE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY WITH OTHERS, BUT THERE WAS RESISTANCE OR TENSION. DISCUSS STRATEGIES YOU TRIED AT THE TIME, HOW EFFECTIVE THEY WERE, AND YOUR REFLECTIONS ON WHAT OTHER STRATEGIES YOU WOULD TRY NOW AND WHY.

      I briefly worked at a menswear shop where my manager would say degrading things about customers weight. I mostly gave him the cold shoulder and it made me very uncomfortable. I told the assistant manager who spoke to him about this. He didn’t seem to really understand the weight of his actions but he did stop saying those comments in front of me. I think it was the right call to ask my assistant manager to speak to him for me as she had known him much longer. I was glad he stopped making those comments but I did leave that job as soon as I could. I would probably do the same thing now.
