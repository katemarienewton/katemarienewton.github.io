      NEUROPLASTICITY
    </p>
    <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
      Benefits of neural plasticity include enhanced learning and memory, recovery from brain injuries and improved mental health. Recognising that the brain can adapt and change with experience encourages the adoption of effective learning strategies, which further facilitates the acquisition of new skills and knowledge. Awareness of neuroplasticity principles is crucial in rehabilitation as it is the basis of the therapies that help the brain compensate for damaged areas, helping restore lost functions. Understanding neuroplasticity further leads to effective interventions in mental health conditions, as it highlights the brains capacity to adapt and reorganise in response to therapeutic practices.

    <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
      Engaging in neuroplasticity for personal benefit would create personal growth opportunities. This could be continuous learning, physical exercise and mindfulness practices. Learning new skills such as software development, languages or musical instruments promote cognitive flexibility and resilience, contributing to overall health and quality of life. Likewise regular aerobic exercise increases neuroplasticity, leading to increased memory, attention and problem solving skills. Mindfulness practices can also encourage positive structural changes in the brain that are associated with with emotional regulation and stress reduction.
    </p>
    <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
      Neuroplastcity is increased with novel activities, social interactions and quality sleep. New and challenging tasks stimulates brain plasticity by encouraging the formation of new neural pathways. Social interactions and connections can enhance cognitive functions and promote neuroplasticity by exposing the brain to diverse stimuli and perspectives. A lesser focused on element is quality sleep. This is essential for memory consolidation and the removal of neural waste products, supporting overall brain health and adaptability.

      GROWTH MINDSET
    </p>
      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        Embracing a growth mindset has significant implications across various aspects of life with students, workers and individuals performing higher at tasks, remaining resilient and advancing in their desired areas. Traits of perseverance, consistency and adaptability are cultivated and are understood to be obtainable skills rather than innate.

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        I personally need to embrace consistency into my learning journey as I work erratically. Some of this is unavoidable due to my job but I can improve. Curiosity and self evaluation on whether I could teach the skills I have learnt to someone else is a greta marker of understanding and would help my learning journey.

        LEARNING PLAN + GROWTH MINDSET
      </p>
      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        In my learning plan I mentioned that I need to ensure all my tasks are done before having leisure time and I think the growth mindset this still stands true. The growth mindset is encouraging on why leisure time should be the second priority.
