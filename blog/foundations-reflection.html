      WHAT ARE THREE NEW THINGS YOU HAVE LEARNT ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR EGO DUE TO THE HUMAN SKILLS LEARNING?
    </p>
    <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
      <ol class="text-colour alight-text">
        <li>
          Listening to my gut is one of my stronger values. I get that this is a bit woo woo, but I think it's based in science and evolution. Your body has evolved to know things before the mind very often.
        </li>
        <li>
          I value my friends very highly. I am a kind of introverted personality but enjoy socialising very frequently.
        </li>
        <li>
          My task list should be my number one priority always, but I am an easily distracted person and I struggle with consistency. I am trying those silly habit streak apps now haha!
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      WHAT ARE THE ROLE OF VALUES, EMPATHY, AND SELF-AWARENESS IN LEARNING AND PROGRAMMING?
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      I would say mostly these really are relevant to working in a group environment and ensuring a work life balance is in place. It would include the manner in which you communicate with your coworkers and the patience you have for people who have external stressors which are impacting the quality of their work. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT THE HUMAN SKILLS LEARNING?
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      It was mostly what I expected! I like the stuff about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset though. I think these things are important to always keep in mind.
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      WHAT WERE THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN SKILLS LEARNING?
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      I personally am not on any social media and am actually slightly uncomfortable writing about myself on even these webpages that only the other students can see. I would rather a private journal of sorts. I am quite conscious of the fact I would rather have little to no digital footprint.
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      WHY DO YOU THINK WE, A PROGRAMMING SCHOOL, ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON HUMAN SKILLS LEARNING IN A WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP COURSE?
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      Coding requires working with other people and other teams, the better you can communicate, the easier you are to work with. It also always is a pro to have a friendly and open person in your office.
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      DOES THE TIME YOU SPENT STUDYING HUMAN SKILLS LEARNING HERE FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF TIME? SHOULD YOU HAVE JUST USED THAT TIME TO PRACTISE PROGRAMMING INSTEAD? JUSTIFY YOUR ANSWER.
    </p>
    <p class="text-colour alight-text">
      Personally, I feel like my human skills are all good. I currently work in a job that I was hired purely on my human skills and I know my bigger weaknesses are on the technical side. However I understand common personalities for software are more introverted personalities and this part of the course is beneficial for many.
