        PROBLEM BLOCK
      </p>

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        I was blocked on multiple of the Javascript problems from the Katas. I would run tests and get partial fails. Usually if stuck I begin to investigate. I used the methods outlined in the student handbook of looking up how to: ____. I play around until I find a solution that works. 
      </p>

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        It is important to me to be able to breakdown and explain parts of how the Javascript code functions so at the end of most sprints I would write out the code in notation and annotate Esch part of the code and what it did. I used this method for journal papers at university and while it is a slow learning method, I found it immensely helpful to break things down into smaller parts.
      </p>

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        I have often learnt more in depth by going backwards through problems and by being able to explain each piece. I feel I do not understand what I am doing unless I can explain it to someone else. This makes me more competent.
      </p>

      <p class="text-colour alight-text">
        Breaking things down has made me feel more confident in some methods of writing javascript but some still I have not wrapped my head around. Repetition and practice will help.

        ELEGANTLY SOLVED A PROBLEM
      </p>
      
      <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
        This simply has not happened yet. I do not feel I have enough intuitive knowledge to solve Javascript problems without referring to external material.

        PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES
      </p>

      <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
        Pseudocode: <i>Have never done this. I will try this.</i><br>
        Trying something: <i>I am always doing this.</i><br>
        Rubber ducky method: <i>This seems similar to pseudocode.</i><br>
        Reading error messages: <i>This is all I do. This is very helpful.</i><br>
        Console.logging: <i>I have some understanding of this but I am not confident in this.</i><br>
        Googling: <i>I was born in 2000. This is the only thing I know how to do.</i><br>
        Asking peers for help: <i>I unfortunately think many of us are in the same boat, so would opt for coach help first.</i><br>
        Asking coaches for help: <i>I love asking for help on discord.</i><br>
        Improving your processes with reflection: <i>Love this in theory. Do this only sometimes.</i><br>

        REFLECTION ON HELP

      <p  class="text-colour alight-text">
        I am not often reluctant to ask for help. I know it is a fools errand to not ask for help. I am comfortable in seeking help.
